# Warpstorm.com Forum

This message board solution is custom built specifically for Warpstorm.com. You will find many Warpstorm-specific references throughout the code and content. I am more than willing, however, to receive pull requests and help make adjustments that will make the code base more usable for other sites.

This software requires [CodeKicker.BBCode](http://codekicker.de/) and the source from that project is included in this one, albeit heavily reformatted by me and modernized to work with ASP.NET Core and the latest C# features.

Aside from CodeKicker's code, anything else is open and free, so you're welcome to steal anything and everything I've written here. If you do, you would help me feel better about all my time spent here by simply emailing me at yarbro@outlook.com
