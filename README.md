# Warpstorm.com Forum

**!!! Currently not functional !!!**

This project will be slowly growing as I migrate old MVC 4 code from VSO into this new fresh MVC 6 solution. I don't suggest downloading it yet, but you're welcome to view it to get ideas or make suggestions.

You will find many Warpstorm.com-specific content throughout the code. I am not writing this to be a drop-in forum for any website, though I am more than willing to pull or help make adjustments that will make the code base more usable for other sites. This is primarily to allow for open source development for Warpstorm.com specifically.

This software requires [CodeKicker.BBCode](http://codekicker.de/) and the source from that project is included in this one, albeit heavily reformatted by me and modernized to work with .NET Core.
