# Warpstorm.com Forum

**!!! Currently not functional !!!**

This project will be slowly growing as I migrate old MVC 4 code from VSO into this new fresh MVC 6 solution. I don't suggest downloading it yet, 
but you're welcome to view it to get ideas or make suggestions.

You will find many Warpstorm.com-specific content throughout the code. I am not writing this to be a drop-in forum for any website,
though I am more than willing to pull or help make adjustments that will make the code base more usable for other sites. This is primarily to
allow for open source development for Warpstorm.com specifically.

Another goal is to have this functional with DNX 4.x for now. I may try Core 5 at some point in the future when libraries I use such as
CodeKicker.BBCode or HtmlAgilityPack become Core 5 compatible.

This software requires [CodeKicker.BBCode](https://bbcode.codeplex.com/).
